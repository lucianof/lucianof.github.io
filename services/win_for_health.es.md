In May 2006, New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and community partners initiated the Washington-Heights Inwood Network (WIN) for Asthma – a hospital-community partnership designed to improve outcomes for children with poorly controlled asthma.  Bilingual Community Health Workers (CHWs) serve as the single point of contact for families who require comprehensive asthma education, support, and multiple referrals for services such as housing, immigration, and mental health.  The CHWs are based at local community based organizations (CBOs), allowing them to remain anchored in the community while also maintaining a strong presence in the hospital where, during daily rounds, they connect with families who require immediate support.  Since 2006, CHWs have enrolled 730 families of children with high risk asthma, the majority of whom received a comprehensive home environmental assessment, trigger reducing tips, asthma education, and on-going support. Among all program graduates to date, hospitalizations decreased by 70%, emergency department (ED) visits decreased by 55%, and 98% of caregivers reported feeling able to manage their child’s asthma.

In 2010, NYP and community partners created WIN for Health to expand services to patients struggling with disease beyond pediatric asthma and to integrate the CHWs into the medical home where they would become active members of the health care team.  Starting in November 2010, CHWs began offering practice-based support to pediatric asthma patients and their family members/caregivers and in February 2011, CHWs began offering support to adult diabetic patients and their family members/caregivers. To date, 1570 patients have received practice-based support and nearly 80 patients are actively enrolled in the year-long diabetes care coordination program.

CLOTH has been a partner since 2005 and currently employs two Community Health Workers through the WIN for Health program, Violeta Alvarado and Maritza Guillermo.
