### Current list of courses

__Computer Classes:__ The Community Computer Classes were started in order to teach computer basics to people with little or no experience. Basic, Intermediate and Advanced level computer classes are offered. The curriculum includes Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and the Internet. For participants over the age of 55, we offer a Cyber Seniors computer training course.  This is a slower paced, loosely structured course that caters to the needs of older students.

Students in this free program have the opportunity to enter a free home health aide training program leading to certification and job placement.

__English as a Second Language Course:__ This course is held twice a week and it is taught by teachers provided by our partners the Manhattan Educational Opportunity Center (MEOC).  In this course, students learn conversational English as well as grammar, vocabulary and spelling.  

__Open Access Computer Lab:__ During open access hours students in the Computer, ESL and Home Health Aide classes have access to computers and printer to complete assignments and improve skills.
