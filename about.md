## HISTORY

The Community League of the Heights (CLOTH) was incorporated in January of 1952 by Lucille Bulger. A strong advocate for the education and welfare of children, Ms. Bulger and other parents on 159th Street recognized the need for recreational and educational resources available to youth in the neighborhood.

Pooling their resources, they engaged the services of bus companies and camps so that neighborhood youth could spend two to four weeks outside of the city during the summer.

From this effort CLOTH began to provide a volunteer-run, educational after school program, a young adult etiquette and social skills program, and a family oriented neighborhood clean-up initiative.

Since its inception, CLOTH has grown from a volunteer agency to a multi-faceted organization. CLOTH addresses a wide range of community needs, including affordable housing, economic development, health education, and after school and summer programs.
