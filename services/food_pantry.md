The food pantryâ€™s mission is to provide hunger relief assistance to adults, children seniors and families in uptown Manhattan. We strive to provide members of our community with nutritious foods that help them lead healthier lives. We serve over 200 hundred families a week, thanks to generous partnerships with United Way, City Harvest, Driscoll Foods, and Food Bank for New York City.

Due to the increasing number of people seeking hunger relief and the limited quantity of food, we ask that everyone comes once a week.

To participate in our food pantry, we require photo ID.
