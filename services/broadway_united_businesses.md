As part of CLOTH's commitment to maintain and sustain vital partnerships 
with the community, we have identified the need to organize and mobilize the 
small business and property owners along the Broadway corridor in 
Southern Washington Heights. In 2007, Broadway United Businesses was 
formed as a merchants association to represent businesses along the central 
economic corridor of the neighborhood. Presently, BUB's boundaries 
are North of West 155th Street to West 170th Street. BUB intends on 
expanding its northern boundary to West 179th Street to expand BUB resources 
and advocacy. 

Broadway United Businesses represents the Southern part of Washington 
Heights which is dedicated to promote Broadway as a major central economic 
hub by developing a strong merchants association and a thriving corridor 
that attracts residents, small business owners, consumers and visitors. BUB 
intends on making Broadway an attractive corridor by:

- Marketing and promoting Broadway as a visitor and consumer destination with artistic and cultural events.

- Making capital improvements to streets and landscapes.

- Performing street maintenance services to ensure clean store fronts and streets.

- Conducting public safety patrols to enhance the quality of life of the corridor.

- Creating advocacy Programs and initiatives that improve the overall economic conditions of Southern Washington Heights and providing continuous support for small business owners to ensure economic vitally.
