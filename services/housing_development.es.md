The mission of CLOTH’s Housing Development Department is to preserve and develop the housing stock of Southern Washington Heights for low-income families. The majority of CLOTH’s development has been the rehabilitation of existing housing. CLOTH has recently expanded its’ development activities to include new construction projects; one 38-unit project is completed and occupied and another 42-units are in construction.  CLOTH’s Healthy Housing Initiative has produced 77 units of “green” rental housing, which improves indoor air quality and reduces energy costs.  The construction of all future projects will include Enterprise’s Green Communities Criteria which will deliver significant health, economic and environmental benefits to residents of the buildings.

Since CLOTH's housing program began over 20 years ago, CLOTH has developed over 1,500 units of housing, and owns over 300 units of affordable housing. CLOTH’s development pipeline for 2012 includes another 80 units to be rehabilitated under HPD’s Third Party Transfer Program.

All of CLOTH’s projects are marketed in accordance with HPD’s and HUD’s Fair Housing Guidelines. Contact 212.795.4779 for information on applications, income and other requirements.
