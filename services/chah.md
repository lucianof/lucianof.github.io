Community Health Academy of the Heights was founded by the 
Community League of the Heights (CLOTH) in partnership with New York 
Presbyterian Hospital, the Columbia University Medical Center, and New 
Visions for Public Schools in September of 2006. The Academy's lead 
partner, CLOTH, has served the community of Washington Heights for 60 
years, providing educational and recreational programs to youth, as well as 
housing, nutritional and health services for the community as a whole. The 
school was established to provide middle and high school students with a 
rigorous college-preparatory curriculum while gaining experience and 
knowledge in the health care field. In its current configuration, CLOTH 
maintains a daily presence on the CHAH campus in the person of a 
Counselor-Advocate/School Liaison who provides counseling services to 
students, coordinates after school activities, manages student internships 
and serves as a liaison between the school and CLOTH. In January of 2013, 
it is projected that the school and CLOTH will relocate to the Lucille 
Bulger Center for Community Life, currently under construction on West 158th 
St. When the building is complete, CHAH will reside at the center of a vital 
network of community services including the CLOTH offices and a full-service 
Community Health Network clinic.
