The Vision for the After School Program is to engage students in learning, by providing comprehensive educational opportunities and experiences, ensure their success in school, and provide an intellectual foundation to succeed in their workplace and in their life.

The After School Program provides students with the skills and knowledge necessary to successfully complete elementary grades. Through the years, CLOTH has created a variety of youth programs focused on self-development through academic growth, mentorship and structured educational activities, tutoring and homework assistance. Our programs foster critical and logical thinking, encouraging abstract thought, positive reasoning, promoting exposure to and appreciation for cultural diversity and arming our students with the knowledge of the fundamentals of math, reading and writing. 

Programs are implemented to give students in our elementary grades, the necessary tools to allow for a smooth transition into middle school, high school and higher education.

## Summer Program

Summer programs vary, but always include youth employment opportunities through SYEP. During the summer program, West 159th Street is opened as a supervised car-free “play street” for neighborhood children and a day program for kid’s ages 6 to 10 that includes educational and recreational activities and free lunch.
