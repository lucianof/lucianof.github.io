__Mission Statement:__


The program believes that when students become the leaders of their lives 
they can become the leaders of their communities. This program is a yearlong 
of daytime and afterschool programming focused on academic support, 
leadership skill building, peer education and training, mentoring/tutoring, 
literacy building, presentation and communications skills, team building, 
career planning and service learning. Every participant will receive ongoing 
one-on-one individual counseling and support from the Counselor-Advocate. 
The overarching three goals of the program are: 1) Develop students academic 
abilities and skills to begin the path of college and career readiness, 2) 
Help students become better people through the development of their service 
learning, leadership and self efficacy skills, 3) Provide students with 
access to resources and training to develop their independence, 
job-readiness and college preparation skills. We want our students to walk 
away equipped to succeed and inspired to move forward.

The overarching objective of the program is to ensure that all participants 
successfully "graduate" ninth grade and are able to accumulate the credits 
needed to transition to the 10th grade. The strategies employed are the 
same strategies which the school employs for all students --- encouraging 
parent participation, focusing on individual students' needs, taking a team 
approach to student progress, offering programs and services designed to 
meet the needs of each student.
